# SortingVisualization

We go over 5 sorting techniques (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort). 

These sorting techniques are compared and their performance over different parameters are measured over various different datasets. To help with measuring the performance, we visualize how the sorting is done in each technique over different datasets using a tool I have developed.

I hope this video will give you an idea on how you can choose what sorting technique to use for sorting a dataset!
